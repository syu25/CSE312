What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?
Emoji Mart is a Slack-like customizable emoji picker component for React.
No more extra features, just a simple component with a few easy props.
emoji-mart provided us with an emoji picker component for React. It enabled us to allow the user 
to choose any emoji provided to include in their comments for their multimedia. 

How does this technology accomplish what it does?

import 'emoji-mart/css/emoji-mart.css'
import { Picker } from 'emoji-mart'

         <Picker onSelect={this.addEmoji} />

It creates a Picker Component that allows the user to click on any of the emojis shown. 
This will then trigger an event called addEmoji. In our project, it addEmoji adds the 
clicked emoji to the back of the message string.
