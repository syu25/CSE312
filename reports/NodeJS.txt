What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?

->This is an open source JavaScript runtime that provides many of the scripts
required to run a basic web server socket. It contains well documented settings
pages that allow its users the modify the operation of the server, in addition
to slots for unlimited expansion of the servers dunctionality beyond the included
functionality. We also utilized its capablities to provide real time feedback to
connected clients, which makes trouble shooting very easy. Additionally, the 
frameworks design to be event based flows very well with our design style, making
future developement easier.



How does this technology accomplish what it does?

->This technology employs the above mentioned features through a thread-based
networking design that allows real-time feedback and ease of developement easily
attainable. NodeJS also has operating system dependent requirnments that translate
into the same basic functions, which allows the server to operate flawlessly on
linux, MacOS, and windows. Essentailly, it implments a layering design to ensure 
proper functionality accross system types. Finally, an equaly important system design
that was implemented in NodeJS to ensure optimal functionality was it event-based
handling of user requests, which is implemented using a multi-thread pool design to
allow for the quick handling of multiple requests while reducing system overhead, thus allowing for real time feedback.
