What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?

->This is an open sourced we application framework that is utilized in developing web
applications, and works particularly well with MongoDB. It is also commonly implemented
when using Node.js, which we used in this project since phase 1. This framework served
mainly as an implementation tool, as there are many resources avalible, free of charge,
that explain how to leverage it to design a nice and reliable web application. Another
major feature of express.js is that it was deisgned from the beginning to support mobile
applications, which is something we wanted to include due to its growing importance in 
world. Express also helps a lot when implementing http uttilities, which was required for
accessing and updating the MongoDB database.



How does this technology accomplish what it does?

->This technology employs the above mentioned features through easy to use and understand
standards, that also allow for a high degree of flexability. This is particularly important
because no one is ever going to implement one thing in the exact same way, which requires non-
rigid standards to allow for an ease of access and use. Additionally, expresses relatively new
design takes into account the more common protocols utilized in many modern web applications, 
which is something many older libraries cannot offer. This made Express an obvious choice to 
include when designing our web application.
