What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?

->MongoDB acts as the backend NoSQL based database for the social media platform that we
implemented for phase 2. It containes a well developed set of commands that can be used to
easily store and retreive the data shared on the platform. One of the major benifits to using
this on our backend was the relative easy of implementation and use. The command structure
was both familar with the some of our developers, in addition to being easy to pick up for
those of us who were not well versed in it. A final major benifit of MongoDB, and possibily 
one of the biggest for our project, was the lack of a file saving standard to be set upon
files stored in the system. In many databases, there are strick file standards that are 
enforced, which can make it challenging to store both text and image files. This is not
the case with MongoDB, which made our lives much easier.


How does this technology accomplish what it does?

->This technology employs the above mentioned through the use of fast-query-access, which
was a major selling point for the database. Not only does this implementation method
increase efficiency, it also allows thye user to implement the databse in a non-ridged
manner, meaning it can be easily tallored. For example, this databse structure is both
maluable enough to be implemented across a distributed system, yet verstile enough to
scale to the individual databases needs. Pervious SQL databases did not offer nearly as
many features as NoSQL, the backbone of MongoDB.
