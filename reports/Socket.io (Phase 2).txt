What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?

->Socket.io provides the basic utilities required to allow out web application to handle
more complicated file serving requests too and form the client to the server. Within
phase 2, we are required to develop a database which can store and serve image files and
text data that have been shared on the social media platform. Socket.io provides full
websocket support that will allow for a more professional finish on the application, by
allowing for automatic updats that don't require an entire page refresh. Finally, Socket.io
provides a well documented set of commands that allow ud to easily merge the library 
functionality with our database of choice, MongoDB. An added feature of Socket.io is that
it containes to distinct libraries for both client-side and server-side implementations, 
which simplifies implementation.


How does this technology accomplish what it does?

->Socket.io utilizes the websocket protocol for communicating between nodes within
its defined network. This allows for easy page updates, as well as content updates
without the need to manually refresh the page. Also, by being exclusive in the fact
that it will only look for and connect to other websocket enabled ports, it reduces
the complexeties of cross-standard compatability requirements that are often imlemented
in similar libraries, reducing this libraries overall complexity. This served to make
it easier to implement.
