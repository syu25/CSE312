What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?

-REACT is a framework that provides a pre-built basic server to server GET
and POST requests. Additionally, the framework provides a sleeker deisgn finish
on the html pages that are served by the server. As the system is even based, it
is also able to provide real-time feedback to page edits and updates without having
to reload the entire page request. Finally, the frameworks pre-built server provides
very detailed implementation instructions that will aid us when it comes times to
add additional functionality to our server in the upcomming phases.



How does this technology accomplish what it does?

->In addition to the pre-written styling files that come with this framework to
impove the overall look of the implemented html code, React implemets a unique 
render function that enables the server to constantly update the pages being deployed
on the server, providing realtime feedback. It does this in conjucion with NodeJS, which
imploys a multi-threaded approach towards processing GET and POST request, even within 
the same request. This highly increases efficiency and the overall user experience of
our web application.
